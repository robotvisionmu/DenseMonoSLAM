# DenseMonoSLAM
A dense monocular SLAM system for capturing dense surfel-based maps of outdoor environments using a single monocular camera.
The code base also supports collaborative mapping sessions with multiple independently moving cameras. Check out the following links to see examples of the system in action; [__dense monocular session__](https://youtu.be/Pn2uaVqjskY), [__collaborative session__](https://youtu.be/GUtHrKEM85M)

# Building The System
First checkout the code and all of the submodules. Change directory into the orb_slam subdirectory and follow the build instructions there. Next change directory into the ElasticFusion sub directory and follow the build instructions there.
